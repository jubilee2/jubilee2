# Jubilee Tan

**Healthcare Data Engineer & Research Informatics**  
Building reproducible EHR pipelines (Spark/BigQuery) and data governance tooling (REDCap).

I design and operationalize healthcare data workflows that improve cohort discovery, reporting quality, and clinical research readiness.

## Focus Areas

- Scalable cohort extraction and phenotype pipelines in Spark/Databricks/BigQuery
- Temporal EHR event modeling, overlap resolution, and QA automation
- REDCap access governance and role automation for compliant research operations

## What I’m Looking For

Open to collaborations and roles where data engineering, translational research, and trustworthy analytics intersect.

## Featured Projects

1. [Pregnancy Episode / Cohort Pipeline](/projects/pregnancy-pipeline/) — longitudinal episode construction with PySpark + NLP + rules.
2. [All of Us Phenotype Pulls at Scale](/projects/all-of-us-phenotype-pulls/) — reproducible cohort extraction patterns in BigQuery/Databricks.
3. [REDCap Role Automation & Governance](/projects/redcap-automation/) — scalable permission workflows using `rcWRAP` + `rcELves`.
