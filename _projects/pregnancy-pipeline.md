## Problem

Clinical and research teams needed reliable pregnancy episode timelines from fragmented EHR events.

## Approach

- Combined temporal heuristics with NLP-derived evidence to infer episode boundaries
- Implemented Spark-based transformation stages for scale and reproducibility
- Added QA checks for overlap resolution, edge cases, and date consistency

## Impact

- Reduced manual curation burden for cohort preparation
- Improved consistency of episode definitions across downstream analyses
