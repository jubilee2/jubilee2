## Problem

Research teams required recurring reports to be generated and delivered on schedule with minimal manual intervention.

## Approach

- Built a chronological scheduling workflow for coded and R Markdown reports with fixed and dynamic delivery cadences
- Implemented whitelist-based report email distribution with recipient validation and delivery audit logs
- Added pre-run data freshness and parameter validation checks to catch stale inputs before report generation
- Standardized outputs into reusable parameterized report templates (PDF/HTML)
- Continued optimization to increase reliability and throughput over time

## Impact

- Scaled to more than 200 reports per week with reliable recurring delivery
- Reduced manual reporting overhead and improved consistency
- Improved delivery reliability by surfacing data/input and routing issues before distribution
- Recognized with the VUMC Department of Biostatistics IT Innovation Award (2022)
