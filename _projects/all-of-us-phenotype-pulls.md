## Scope

Contributed to analytics and quality-control workflows for large research cohorts, including the NIH All of Us program and Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative environment.

## What I Built

- Reproducible query patterns for cohort pulls and data checks
- Validation workflows to improve confidence in researcher-facing datasets
- Documentation and handoff patterns for iterative research requests
- Multi-million-row longitudinal event processing across diagnoses, procedures, medications, and laboratory domains
- QA check suite for overlap handling, date-window consistency, code-list coverage, and cross-source count reconciliation
- Reusable analyst outputs: phenotype-ready cohort tables, QC summary tables, and notebook-based review artifacts

## Impact

- Supported recurring cohort refresh cycles (daily to weekly, depending on study requirements)
- Helped accelerate time-to-cohort for investigator-led studies
- Improved repeatability and transparency of extraction logic across requests through attached QC outputs
