## Scope

Implemented multiple REDCap-integrated services to support clinical research operations and participant engagement.

## What I Built

- External support applications for:
  - Electronic consent workflows
  - Follow-up and missing-survey reminders
  - Coordinator notifications
  - Randomization support
  - Participant status/health index monitoring dashboards
  - Data synchronization between systems
  - Drug delivery tracking integrations
- Messaging-based participant interaction workflows using Twilio
- REDCap Clinical Data Pull configuration using FHIR-based records integration
- Scheduled and event-driven integration pipelines (daily batch plus near-real-time triggers) for cross-system updates
- QA and governance checks for consent-state transitions, survey-window timing, randomization constraints, and interface auditability
- Reusable operator-facing outputs including coordinator dashboards, reminder queues, and delivery tracking views

## Impact

- Improved operational efficiency for multi-study teams through standardized workflows
- Increased consistency of participant communication workflows
- Strengthened integration between research data capture and clinical source systems
