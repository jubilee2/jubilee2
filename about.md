I am a Senior Application Developer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Center for Quantitative Sciences), focused on research informatics and healthcare data engineering.

- **Professional name:** Jubilee Tan  
- **Formal name:** HSI-NIEN TAN

My work centers on transforming clinical and research data into reproducible, analysis-ready assets that support investigators, statisticians, and study teams.

## Professional Focus

I build usable, maintainable data products and workflows that translate research and clinical requirements into reliable delivery—emphasizing data quality, traceability, and cross-platform integration. I also draw on years of full-stack delivery experience to connect requirement discovery, workflow design, and implementation into robust and reliable operational systems.

- Large-scale research data analytics and quality control (QC/QA)
- EHR-derived cohort extraction, validation, and data reconciliation workflows
- Automation of recurring reporting and delivery pipelines (reproducible pipelines)
- REDCap platform implementation and external support tooling
- Research operations enablement through reliable APIs and platform integration
