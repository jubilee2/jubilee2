## Current Role Focus

I build usable, maintainable data products and workflows that translate research and clinical requirements into reliable delivery—emphasizing data quality, traceability, and cross-platform integration. I also draw on years of full-stack delivery experience to connect requirement discovery, workflow design, and implementation into systems that keep running in real operations.

- Large-scale research data analytics and quality control (QC/QA)
- EHR-derived cohort extraction, validation, and data reconciliation workflows
- Automation of recurring reporting and delivery pipelines (reproducible pipelines)
- REDCap platform implementation and external support tooling
- Research operations enablement through reliable APIs and platform integration
